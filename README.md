# DANOS Tests

## Contributing

See the [DANOS Project Wiki][1] for details of contributing to the project.

### Developer Certificate of Origin

The project maintainers for DANOS will only accept contributions using the
[Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1][2] (“DCO”). The DCO is a legally binding
statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you
otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are
intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated
with the given repository.

You can agree to the DCO in your contribution by using a “Signed-off-by” line
at the end of your commit message. You should only submit a contribution if you
are willing to agree to the DCO terms. If you are willing, just add a line to
the end of every git commit message:

```Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>```

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However,
Git makes it easy to add this line to your commit messages. If you set your
`user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git configuration, you can sign
your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
